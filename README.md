Goal
The goal of this notebook is to tell a story of the air quality till the year 2019 and in 2020. Due to lockdown in many countries, how the pandemic has played a role in the air quality.
Questions I want to address are:
1.) What was the average AQI before and in 2020 in each country?
2.) What was the highest occuring pollutant in top 5 country before and in 2020?
